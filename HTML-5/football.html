             <p class="text">The UEFA European Football Championship, less formally, the European Championship (EC) and informally as the Euros, is the primary association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), determining the continental champion of Europe. The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the European Nations' Cup, changing to the current name in 1968. The individual events are branded in the form of "UEFA Euro [year]".

            Before entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process. Until 2016 the championship winners could compete in the following FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.
            
            The fifteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, France has won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Italy, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team in history to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.
            
            The most recent championship, hosted by France in 2016, was won by Portugal, who beat France 1–0 in the final at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis after extra time. The match averaged 284 million viewers, making it the second-most watched game in European tournament history</p>

            <p class="eriksen">Euro 2020 will be remembered for a number of events. One thing has been the big upsets in the round of 16 as some of the favorite nations to win the title (France, Germany, Portugal) went out. But another major incident is likely to live long in the memory for most: the cardiac arrest that Denmark’s Cristian Eriksen suffered in the first Group B fixture against Finland.Daley Blind, who competed at the European Championship with the Netherlands, also wears an ICD heart-starting device after suffering a similar health scare two years ago.
                He has been able to successfully resume his career and despite calls for Eriksen to call it a day, he didn’t hesitate to support Eriksen to do the same and continue. “I am proud of myself that I managed to play for so long in that game. I did it, but it was hard,” he admitted.
                "The images from Copenhagen, with Christian lying on the grass, had such a big impact on me.
                “Those images were so recognizable to me. It was so real again, this is why it was so emotional for me,” he added.</p>
